Here are some very important decisions that i'm taking while working on this application.

1. users must be registered to do the following:
↳ perform crud operations for a task without a workspace
↳ create a profile
↳ create a workspace
↳ send members an invitation to join workspace

2. users needs to create a profile in order to do the following:
↳ send or receive an invite to join a workspace
↳ after joining a workspace, they can now be given tasks there

3. A workspace owner cannot invite himself to join same workspace
