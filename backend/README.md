## How go run migrations

â˜• Just open a terminal and run the following command
`npm run m:gen src/database/migrations/${NameOfNewMigration}`

And.. voila, that's gonna be saved to the migrations folder.

Please, don't bother to run the migration as it automatically gets run whenever the application start.
